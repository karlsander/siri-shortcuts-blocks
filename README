A modular (aka messily interconnected) set of blocks for building powerful and easy to understand shortcuts with the Siri Shortcuts app.

## Functions

Functions are shortcuts that are meant to be used inside Shortcuts with the `Run Shortcuts` action. Their name always starts with / and ends with a version number. The version number is only increased for breaking changes (so that links in other workflows don't break). Versions 0 may include breaking changes.

## Settings

A lot of these workflows (will) rely on settings.json stored in icloud drive. There is a shortcut to manage settings in that file. This is not as user friendly as import question, but it allows for easy sharing and changing of values.

## Workflows

These are not versioned and are meant to be used and edited directly.
